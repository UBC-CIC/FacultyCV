## Overview

Welcome to the Faculty CV digital platform, a solution developed by the UBC CIC team in collaboration with the UBC Faculty of Medicine. This platform is designed to streamline the process of creating and managing UBC-standardized Curriculum Vitae (CV) for faculty members, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing administrative burdens.

### Purpose

The primary objective of this platform is to centralize and standardize the collection and management of academic outputs, allowing faculty members to generate CVs with greater ease and consistency. By integrating data from various internal and external sources, the platform reduces the time and effort required to compile CVs, thereby enabling faculty members to focus on their core responsibilities, such as research, teaching, and clinical duties.

### Key Features

- **Centralized Data Repository:** Faculty members can access and integrate their academic output data into a single, digital repository, simplifying the CV creation process.
- **UBC-Standardized CV Generation:** The platform allows faculty to easily generate CVs that meet UBC's standardized requirements, which can be used for various academic and professional purposes.
- **Delegation of Tasks:** Faculty members can delegate data entry and profile management tasks to designated assistants, streamlining administrative processes.
- **Data Insights:** Department heads, research directors, and faculty leadership can access detailed reports on faculty activities, supporting strategic planning and decision-making.

### User Roles

The platform is designed to accommodate various user roles, each with specific permissions and functionalities:

- **Faculty Members:** Create, manage, and update their academic profiles and generate standardized CVs.
- **Assistants:** Support faculty members by managing data entry and profile updates.
- **Department Admins:** Oversee the management of faculty data within their department, generate reports, and coordinate faculty activities.
- **Admins:** Administer the platform, manage user roles and permissions, and ensure the smooth operation of the system.


### Basic Navigation Tips

The platform features an intuitive interface that guides users through the process of managing their academic work records and generating reports. Key concepts to understand include:

- **Academic Work Records:** These records store your professional and academic activities in the cloud. Examples of sections include:
  - **Teaching:** Covers activities like courses taught and student supervision.
  - **Publications:** Includes your scholarly publications and other academic contributions.
  - **Service to the Community:** Encompasses activities such as memberships on committees and editorial work.

  Entries within these sections can either be manually entered or automatically pulled from external data sources, such as Scopus or the European Patent Office.

- **Reports:** These are the outputs that translate your academic work records into formatted PDFs, useful for various academic and professional purposes.

- **Templates:** Templates define the structure of the reports, specifying which sections of your academic work records are included and the order in which they appear.

- **Archiving and Deletion:** Any deleted entry is moved to an archive, where it can be restored within three months. After this period, it is permanently deleted.

For more detailed instructions on using these features, refer to the relevant sections of this guide based on your assigned role.
